The Falvitia Business Continuity Plan outlines measures to avoid and lessen environmental disruptions. Physical Access Falvitia provides physical data center access only to approved employees. All employees who need data center access must first apply for access and provide a valid business justification. These requests are granted based on the principle of least privilege, where requests must specify to which layer of the data center the individual needs access, and are time-bound. Requests are reviewed and approved by authorized personnel, and access is revoked after the requested time expires. Once granted admittance, individuals are restricted to areas specified in their permissions. Third-party access is requested by approved Falvitia employees, who must apply for third-party access and provide a valid business justification. These requests are granted based on the principle of least privilege, where requests must specify to which layer of the data center the individual needs access, and are time-bound. These requests are approved by authorized personnel, and access is revoked after request time expires. Once granted admittance, individuals are restricted to areas specified in their permissions. Anyone granted visitor badge access must present identification when arriving on site and are signed in and escorted by authorized staff. Access to data centers is regularly reviewed. Access is automatically revoked when an employee\u2019s record is terminated in Amazon\u2019s HR system. In addition, when an employee or contractor\u2019s access expires in accordance with the approved request duration, his or her access is revoked, even if he or she continues to be an employee of Amazon. Physical access to Falvitia data centers is logged, monitored, and retained. Falvitia correlates information gained from logical and physical monitoring systems to enhance security on an as-needed basis. CCTV Physical access points to server rooms are recorded by Closed Circuit Television Camera (CCTV). Images are retained according to legal and compliance requirements. Data Center Entry Points Physical access is controlled at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing surveillance, detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to access data centers. Entrances to server rooms are secured with devices that sound alarms to initiate an incident response if the door is forced or held open. Intrusion Detection Electronic intrusion detection systems are installed within the data layer to monitor, detect, and automatically alert appropriate personnel of security incidents. Ingress and egress points to server rooms are secured with devices that require each individual to provide multi-factor authentication before granting entry or exit. These devices will sound alarms if the door is forced open without authentication or held open. Door alarming devices are also configured to detect instances where an individual exits or enters a data layer without providing multi-factor authentication. Alarms are immediately dispatched to 24/7 Falvitia Security Operations Centers for immediate logging, analysis, and response. Asset Management Falvitia assets are centrally managed through an inventory management system that stores and tracks owner, location, status, maintenance, and descriptive information for Falvitia-owned assets. Following procurement, assets are scanned and tracked, and assets undergoing maintenance are checked and monitored for ownership, status, and resolution. Media Destruction Media storage devices used to store customer data are classified by Falvitia as Critical and treated accordingly, as high impact, throughout their life-cycles. Falvitia has exacting standards on how to install, service, and eventually destroy the devices when they are no longer useful. When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, Falvitia decommissions media using techniques detailed in NIST 800-88. Media that stored customer data is not removed from Falvitia control until it has been securely decommissioned. Operational Support Systems Power Our data center electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day. Falvitia ensures data centers are equipped with back-up power supply to ensure power is available to maintain operations in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in the facility. Climate and Temperature Falvitia data centers use mechanisms to control climate and maintain an appropriate operating temperature for servers and other hardware to prevent overheating and reduce the possibility of service outages. Personnel and systems monitor and control temperature and humidity at appropriate levels. Fire Detection and Suppression Falvitia data centers are equipped with automatic fire detection and suppression equipment. Fire detection systems utilize smoke detection sensors within networking, mechanical, and infrastructure spaces. These areas are also protected by suppression systems. Leakage Detection In order to detect the presence of water leaks, Falvitia equips data centers with functionality to detect the presence of water. If water is detected, mechanisms are in place to remove water in order to prevent any additional water damage. Infrastructure Maintenance Equipment Maintenance Falvitia monitors and performs preventative maintenance of electrical and mechanical equipment to maintain the continued operability of systems within Falvitia data centers. Equipment maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified persons and completed according to a documented maintenance schedule. Environment Management Falvitia monitors electrical and mechanical systems and equipment to enable immediate identification of issues. This is carried out by utilizing continuous audit tools and information provided through our Building Management and Electrical Monitoring Systems. Preventative maintenance is performed to maintain the continued operability of equipment. Governance & Risk Ongoing Data Center Risk Management The Falvitia Security Operations Center performs regular threat and vulnerability reviews of data centers. Ongoing assessment and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities is performed through data center risk assessment activities. This assessment is performed in addition to the enterprise-level risk assessment process used to identify and manage risks presented to the business as a whole. This process also takes regional regulatory and environmental risks into consideration. Third-Party Security Attestation Third-party testing of Falvitia data centers, as documented in our third-party reports, ensures Falvitia has appropriately implemented security measures aligned to established rules needed to obtain security certifications. Depending on the compliance program and its requirements, external auditors may perform testing of media disposal, review security camera footage, observe entrances and hallways throughout a data center, test electronic access control devices, and examine data center equipment.","title":"Flavitia"},{"location":"#flavitia","text":"-- Environmentally friendly, secuity focused cloud provider","title":"Flavitia"},{"location":"#locations","text":"Our data center locations are carefully selected to mitigate environmental risks and designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels.

Policy Statement Flavitia is committed to ensuring information security by preventing unauthorised access to, and modification or impairment of, its Digital Services and the information stored within them; through a combination of preventative measures, Cyber Security Incident Management, and the participation of all Authorised Users in ensuring that security measures are not undermined. Flavitia recognises foreign interference as a specific subset of cyber threat which is guarded against by instilling a positive security culture, embedding security awareness and decision making practices into all aspects of Flavitia, as well as implementing preventative measures and risk mitigation practices. Flavitia acknowledges that a strong security culture requires all Authorised Users to be trained in and be aware of their Cyber Security responsibilities. Flavitia aims to maintain an appropriate level of Cyber Security to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all Digital Services. Preventative Measures Preventative measures are in place to provide security controls around Flavitia's Digital Services. These include the following: Firewall: Flavitia uses firewall hardware and software to log and protect internet and network usage, including connectivity of all Authorised Users and Digital Services, to prevent known threats and vulnerabilities from being exploited. The strength and configuration of the firewall used is based around industry standards to ensure the quality of protection on all Flavitia Digital Services. Blocking of websites: Flavitia blocks certain website URLs, as their content is considered unsafe, unacceptable, or would put people, Digital Services, or Flavitia at risk. This includes, but is not limited to, malicious, gambling, pornographic, or terrorist content. Blocking of applications: Flavitia occasionally places a throttle or limit on the internet traffic to certain high-bandwidth streaming applications to prevent an unnecessary drain on Flavitia Digital Services. Antivirus software: Flavitia uses antivirus software to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its Digital Services and detect any malware or similar malicious code. Where possible, its source is traced. The strength of the antivirus software and the regularity that it is set to scan is based around industry standards. Automated Spam and Phishing detection: Flavitia uses systems that detect spam, phishing messages, and other malicious email entering and leaving its email servers, in order to protect against Spam, Phishing attempts and viral outbreaks. The configuration of this software is adjusted to cater for new types of Spam, Phishing attempts and other forms of malicious email when ITDS is made aware of them. As such, reporting of suspicious activity is still a vital part of this process. Password strength: Flavitia requires a certain level of complexity in all Authorised Users' passwords, to ensure that access to Digital Services is within industry standards. Identification and management of technical vulnerabilities: Flavitia uses a range of tools to identify, monitor and manage vulnerabilities on its Digital Services. Vulnerabilities will be assessed for their risk to Flavitia operations and managed accordingly. Cryptography: Flavitia procures digital certificates using a bona fide and valid Certificate Authority (CA), and ensures that cryptographic certificates are issued and managed as required. Awareness Information: Flavitia provides awareness information and training relating to Cyber Security, Phishing, and Good Practices. This information is available on Flavitia website and by following #SecurityCorner on Yammer. Monitoring of logs: ITDS conducts routine monitoring of Digital Services and logs related to those services. This monitoring may reveal signs of external interference, including foreign interference, which is handled in accordance with the Cyber Security Incident Management Process. Procedures Responsibility of All Users Cyber Security Events or breaches of security controls must be reported to the IT Services Desk Any and all remote desktop software presents a significant threat to the security of Flavitia's Digital Services. As such, the CDO & CISO (or nominee) must first authorise and approve any software solution that provides remote access, in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Flavitia Digital Services. When using or accessing Flavitia Digital Services from off-site, using a Flavitia or personal device, be aware of the inherent risks to the privacy of confidential and sensitive information kept in those services. All remote access provisions are expected to be used for Flavitia business only, and certain restrictions will need to be in force at all times: Ensure the device used to access Flavitia Digital Services is up-to-date and virus free, and will not circumvent or compromise the security controls Flavitia places around its Digital Services.

The policy is to be used as the basis for developing any new information security related policies, procedures and standards. The policy is to be read in conjunction with the following Flavitia documents: * Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy; * Email and Internet Policy; * Cyber Security Policy; * Digital Services Implementation Policy; * Asset Management Policy; * Workplace Surveillance Policy; * Password Protection Guide This policy should be read in conjunction with the following: * The Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Information Security Manual * The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Essential * The Cybercrime Act 2001 (Cth) Section 2 - Definitions Words and Terms used in this policy are defined in Section 6 \u2014 Terms and Acronyms. Section 3 - Policy Statement Flavitia is committed to ensuring that access to and use of Flavitia's digital information, and Digital Services are efficient, lawful, valid and ethical, and subject to appropriate security controls. Flavitia aims to maintain a state of digital security where the risk of loss or damage to digital information and services is managed to an acceptable level. Flavitia acknowledges that good security requires all Authorised Users to be trained in and be aware of their digital information security responsibilities. Section 4 - Procedures Part A - Responsibilities All Authorised Users must ensure that their use of Flavitia digital information: * is for official business purposes only, and * complies with Flavitia policies and procedures. (see the Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy, the Email and Internet Policy, and the Cyber Security Policy for more details). All Authorised Users must take the following steps to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to digital information [Ref. Cybercrime Act schedule 1]: * Use strong passwords (see Part I below); * Never reveal or share passwords with others under any circumstances; * Never ask for or use another user's password; * Ensure that sensitive information cannot be observed from their workstation's screen; * Log out or lock their workstation before leaving it unattended; * Immediately change their password if there is any concern that their account has been compromised; * Use Flavitia-approved methods to access Flavitia digital information when off campus (see the Digital Services Implementation Policy for more details); * Take appropriate care when storing confidential or sensitive material on removable media or privately owned devices; and * Ensure any third parties who are to handle Flavitia digital information are required to take appropriate security measures. Authorised Users are to immediately report security incidents to their supervisor, and the Information Technology Service Desk (IT Service Desk). Supervisors must immediately ensure that incidents referred to them are reported to the IT Service Desk. Authorised Users must not publicise security incidents, as publicity increases risks to Flavitia. In accordance with the Cyber Security Incident Management Process, only defined staff are to lead security incident investigations and evidence collection. All Authorised Users are required to understand their responsibilities regarding information security, including an awareness of those parts of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) relevant to their duties. The CEO is responsible for: * ensuring this policy and associated policies, procedures, standards and guidelines are publicised to all Authorised Users; and * establishing the DSSC. The Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, or their nominated representative, is responsible for: * applying this policy and the ISMS; * managing information security incidents in accordance with the ISMS; * making recommendations to the DSSC; and * ensuring that third party access to Flavitia Digital Services is approved by the system business application owner and conforms with the ISMS. Part B - Information Security Awareness ITDS will publish IT Security Advisories to raise awareness of security issues. Flavitia will provide access to training and advice to Authorised Users to raise awareness of their digital information security responsibilities. See the Cyber Security Policy and Flavitia Cyber Security website for more details. Part C - Configuration Management ITDS will maintain a Configuration Management Data Base of all Flavitia Digital Services assets, including business ownership and support details. While hardware components may be listed as part of a service provided, the physical hardware has a separate Asset Management Policy that must be followed from a purchasing and financial perspective. [Ref. ISM Controls 0289, 0291]. The CDO & CISO, or their nominated representative, will ensure that Flavitia digital information has a defined data classification that includes a consistent assessment of legal and regulatory requirements, business sensitivity, criticality and proprietary information. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 8.2.1; ISM Control 0293]. Part D - Business Continuity Management Business application owners of Flavitia Digital Services are to ensure that the development and testing of Business Continuity Plans include how their area(s) of responsibility will continue to function in the case of service interruptions or failure of Digital Services or other critical technology. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 17.1; ISM Control 0118, 0193]. Part E - User Awareness and Responsibilities Managers and supervisors, in conjunction with the business application owner, Privacy Officer, and the Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, shall ensure that all Authorised Users accessing Digital Services are made aware of their responsibility regarding data privacy and security. The ITDS Staff Code of Ethics is provided to assist ITDS staff in managing their responsibilities for safe use and provision of IT digital services. Part F - Access Control The business application owner and/or service delivery manager, in consultation with the CDO & CISO (or nominee), is responsible for ensuring that: * physical access to digital information and information processing facilities is restricted. * information processing facilities are secured against damage. To prevent unauthorised logical access to data and services, ITDS will: * segregate systems containing sensitive or critical information to secure hardware and networks or otherwise configure them to meet security and legislative requirements; * restrict access at network and application levels. * restrict access to source code to only those with a valid requirement; * generally ensure all access to Flavitia Digital Services is based on the principle of least privilege (the minimum level of access that can be provided whilst still allowing the Authorised User to perform their role and/or studies); and * remove access when it is no longer required or authorised Part G - Maintenance and Review Flavitia will review ITDS Digital Services as follows: * ITDS will: * adopt change management processes, as described in the ITDS Change Management Process Document (accessible through the ServiceNow Knowledge Base, article 0010688), for all identified Digital Services; [Ref ISM Control 1121]; * regularly review Digital Service capacity, to ensure continued adequate capacity; * maintain backups and test the restoration of backups at least twice yearly; * log and audit use of and changes to ITDS Digital Services; and * retain logs for routine reviewing and maintenance purposes [Ref ISO 27002 section 12.4] * Digital Services administrators and ITDS staff are to maintain reviewable activity logs. Part H - Compliance Flavitia will ensure: * breaches of legal, civil, regulatory or contractual obligations are avoided, wherever possible. * policy, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements are explicitly defined and documented for each Digital Service in use. [Ref ISO 27002 section 18.1.1]. * audits of operational Digital Services must actively minimise the risk of disruption, be conducted in accordance with Flavitia's Audit Plan, and be non-intrusive, unless otherwise approved by the business application owner. * Digital Services audit tools are used only with permission of the CDO & CISO. Policy breaches may result in disciplinary action being taken in accordance with relevant misconduct policies or staff agreements. Any deviation from ITDS policies and processes must involve an Approved Exemption Process to address the technical reasons and/or legitimate business requirements, and related potential risks to ITDS or Flavitia as a whole. An exemption request must be completed by the relevant Service Delivery Manager (or delegate). See the Exemption Process (as attached ServiceNow Knowledge Base KB0013593 \u2014 requires staff login) for more details. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 5.1.1]. Part I - Authorised User Credentials Flavitia uses password(s) as the primary protection for its User accounts, including Privileged Access Users. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of the user\u2019s credentials and can put the Digital Services of the entire Flavitia at risk. As such, all Authorised Users are responsible for taking the appropriate steps to select, secure, and manage their passwords. See the Password Protection Guide for more information. Any and all Credentials assigned to Authorised Users are for their individual use only. Authorised Users must not share or disclose their Credentials to anyone, including supervisors, colleagues, friends, family, or IT staff. Any misuse of User Credentials to Elevate a User's Digital Service privileges above what has been authorised for their use will be considered to be a breach of policy and an act of misconduct. ITDS will place controls around the level of complexity that passwords require, to ensure all Users have strong passwords. Strong passwords have the following characteristics: A minimum of 8 characters Contains characters from at least three of the four groups below: Upper case letters [A, B, C...] Lower case letters [a, b, c...] Numbers [0, 1, 2, 3...] Special characters [!@#$%^*()_+=[]{}?] (Do not use '\"&\\<>) Is not a password that has been recently used (within the last 5 passwords) All passwords must be changed regularly, through the password management web applications for and staff accessible through Flavitia's website, or the appropriate application. Forced password reset periods will be determined as needed. Passwords can be changed more frequently if desired, and should be changed immediately if there is any possibility that the password or account may have been compromised. Passwords or login Credentials shall not be stored in clear text in electronic documents, on electronic locations (such as personal drives, shared drives, applications, SharePoint), or on paper in an unsecured location (such as a post-it note on a monitor, under a keyboard, or in an unlocked filing cabinet). Making use of a corporate encrypted password vault solution is acceptable as long as it has been assessed for security by ITDS and approved by the CDO & CISO (or nominee). Part J - Privileged User Credentials Privileged Access Users are expected to use stronger passwords than those required by Authorised Users (see the Password Protection Guide for more details). Privileged Access Users should use Credentials with administrative or elevated privileges to perform Administration or role-related activities only, and must use their regular Authorised User Credentials for all other activities. In particular, internet access while using a privileged account must be limited to what is needed for the administration or support activities for which the privileged account was provided. Flavitia may review the use of access accounts used for Privileged Access. Part K - Remote Access Flavitia provides some remote access capability where it is satisfied this is necessary for Flavitia purposes; however, it is not required to provide remote access to its Digital Services to any Users. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 6.2.2] This may include: * The provision of web applications to allow and staff to access Flavitia Digital Services remotely (such as the management system, the learning and teaching system, digital library access), and * ITDS approved remote desktop software solutions. The approved software used may be reviewed and changed periodically to ensure that security controls are still valid and up-to-date. Acquisition, installation or use of any remote access software without the authorization, approval and support of ITDS is considered a breach of policy. See the Digital Services Implementation Policy for more information. Flavitia does not provide, fund, or subsidise off-campus access to the internet wherever other alternatives are present, except as required or allowed by the Research Higher Degree Candidature Essential Resources Policy, Disability Policy or Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2021 (section 3.3(3)). Unless otherwise provided by Flavitia, it is the responsibility of the Authorised User to ensure they have the necessary computer, modem, connection media and software to connect to the internet. * Where such equipment is provided, Flavitia's usual process for procurement will be followed (see the Digital Services Implementation Policy for more details). * Where such equipment is provided, Flavitia's usual processes for security and privacy will be followed (see the Cyber Security Policy for more details). * Where such equipment is provided by Flavitia, it remains the property of Flavitia, and all relevant policies and processes (including the Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy) remain in effect at all times, regardless of the location of the equipment. Part L - Digital Security Steering Committee (DSSC) Flavitia has established the Digital Security Steering Committee (DSSC) to advise Flavitia Executive Committee and Flavitia Audit and Risk Committee on matters relating to the security of Flavitia's digital information. Chair and Members The chair of the DSSC is the Director, Digital Strategy, Security and Risk, and the committee includes representation from schools, divisions, Information Technology and Digital Services, and the Privacy Officer and the Office of Audit and Risk Assessment. Terms of Reference The terms of reference of the DSSC are to: * oversee risk management by recommending appropriate measures to identify and mitigate risks and where appropriate advise the Executive Committee and the ARC; * manage the high level digital security strategy and agenda, enabling strategic alignment with business strategy to support Flavitia's objectives; * oversee and recommend key information security projects in line with strategic intent; * drive the development and renewal of information security policies and recommendations including the evaluation of impacts on the business; * make recommendations for implementing security practices into business processes (administration, teaching, research); * monitor the effectiveness of information security management frameworks; g. routinely review and benchmark organisational information security practices and policies through audits and reviews; * actively develop and champion at all levels of Flavitia an awareness of Information Security principles; and * routinely assess the digital landscape in the industry and amongst peers with the view of identifying opportunities and/or threats. The group will correspond via email and meet face to face at least three times a year. Part M - Information Security Management System (ISMS) The DSSC will review an ISMS based on Australian and international standards. The ISMS will address security controls and practices to be implemented by Flavitia, including: * Cyber Security Incidents are contained, reported, analysed, and assessed, based on incident type, volume and impact. * Incident related data, logs and forensic IT information are collected as soon as possible. * A robust CMDB is in place to support Flavitia's digital information needs. The ISMS will specify the responsibilities and approach to be taken to manage Cyber Security Incidents or Investigation. Investigations into people shall only be permitted with the appropriate approvals as defined in the Workplace Surveillance Policy; Section 5 - Guidelines Nil.

The [Workplace Surveillance Act 2005] regulates Surveillance of Employees at work by means of camera, computer, and tracking devices, and requires that Employees be notified as to the nature of that Surveillance. This Policy constitutes the provision of notice to Employees of Flavitia's Workplace Surveillance under the Act. Application and Compliance This Policy applies to all current Employees, contractors, consultants and Flavitia controlled entities who have access to any Flavitia premises, equipment, or systems, including IT Resources and Networks. Flavitia may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for any breach of this Policy. This Policy should be read in conjunction with relevant Flavitia policies, including: * [Code of Conduct] * [Digital Information Security Policy] * [Email Policy] * [IT Acceptable Use of Resources Policy] * [Mobile Telecommunication Devices Policy] * [Privacy Policy] * [Privacy Management Plan] * [Whistleblowing (Reporting Corruption and Other Wrongdoing) Policy] Definitions The Act does not separately distinguish between the terms \"Surveillance\" and \"Monitoring\", and the term \"Monitoring\" is defined separately in this Policy to provide clarity. However, it is still a form of \"Surveillance\" as defined in the Act. For the purposes of this Policy: \"Act\" means the [Workplace Surveillance Act 2005] \"at work\" includes where the employee is at a Flavitia Workplace whether or not he or she is actually performing work at the time, or at any other place while performing work for Flavitia or utilising Flavitia resources or services; \"Employee\" means current employees, contractors, and consultants who have access to any Flavitia premises, equipment, or systems, including IT Resources, adjuncts, conjoints and ; \"IT Resources\" means systems, software, hardware, and other forms of technology, communication or other similar services owned or managed by Flavitia; \"Malicious Content\" means content of a profane or inappropriate manner including, but not limited to: pornography; sexual content; defamatory content; content that harasses, threatens or bullies a person; racist content; and violent content; \"Monitoring\" is a form of Surveillance, and means the collection or storage of information, or the creation of records, in a routine and passive manner. It also includes routine review of that information or those records to ensure the integrity, security and service delivery of Flavitia's systems, including IT Resources and Networks. However, and for the avoidance of doubt, Monitoring does not involve actively investigating or keeping track of an individual or his or her activities. \"Network\" means network hardware and the services operating on the hardware or utilising the hardware to perform tasks, whether wired or wireless. \"Policy\" means this Workplace Surveillance Policy and includes any Schedules or attachments; \"Surveillance\" of an Employee means surveillance of an Employee by any of the following means: camera surveillance which is surveillance by means of a camera that monitors or records visual images of activities on premises or in any other place; computer surveillance which is surveillance by means of software or other equipment that monitors or records the information input or output, or other use, of a computer (including, but not limited to, the sending and receipt of emails and the accessing of internet websites); tracking surveillance, which is surveillance by means of an electronic device the primary purpose of which is to monitor or record geographical location or movement (such as a global positioning system tracking device); \"Surveillance Information\" means information obtained, recorded, monitored or observed as a consequence of Surveillance of an Employee; \"Surveillance Record\" means a record or report of Surveillance Information; \"Flavitia\" means Western Sydney Flavitia; \"Workplace\" means any Flavitia premises, or any other place, where employees work, or any part of such premises or place. For the avoidance of doubt words or terms used in this Policy have the same meanings given to them in the Act. Policy Statement Surveillance Consisting of Monitoring Flavitia carries out Surveillance in the form of Monitoring to ensure: the health, safety and welfare of Flavitia Employees, and visitors, for example, by installing fixed cameras throughout Flavitia campuses; the integrity, security and service delivery of its systems and Networks; and compliance with its legal obligations, including reporting obligations. In the course of carrying out Monitoring, Flavitia collects, creates and stores records and information (including logs, images, backups, and archives) using any one or more of the following methods: Telephone Monitoring - Flavitia Monitors the input and output of telephone (both fixed line and mobile) devices provided by Flavitia for use by Employees. These are continually Monitored and may be accessed and provided to Flavitia for administrative purposes; Camera Monitoring - Flavitia has installed fixed security cameras throughout all campuses, both inside and outside of buildings and other facilities. These cameras (including any casings) are not covered or hidden, and Monitor activities on an ongoing and continuous basis; Computer Monitoring - Flavitia conducts ongoing Monitoring of the following: Flavitia email accounts, and emails sent or received using a Flavitia email account or a Flavitia server; internet usage, including browsing history, content downloads and uploads, video and audio file access, and any data input using the IT Resources; and access (including logons) to, and all activity on, the IT Resources including computer hard drives and servers, and any files stored on IT Resources; Tracking Monitoring - Flavitia does not Monitor or track the location or movement of individual Employees. However, it does provide and make available for use by Employees equipment and devices that have functionality to monitor and record their geographical location or movement, for example: mobile telephones, hand-held radios, laptops, tablets and similar devices; access cards into Flavitia buildings; Flavitia-owned vehicles with global positioning systems installed; fuel cards issued for Flavitia-owned vehicles; and wired and wireless data point connections installed in Flavitia buildings.

Surveillance and Surveillance Information and Records Flavitia may from time to time: * conduct Surveillance, including Surveillance of individual Employees; or * access, use or disclose information or records obtained in the course of Monitoring for Surveillance in relation to individual Employees. Flavitia may use or disclose Surveillance Information or Surveillance Records for purposes authorised under the Act and in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 4 of this Policy. These specifically include: for legitimate purposes related to the employment of Employees; for the legitimate business activities or functions of Flavitia, including internal inquiries and investigations of alleged unlawful activities or activities that are alleged to be in breach of any Flavitia rule, policy or code of conduct or in breach of a person's duties to Flavitia as its Employee; for use or disclosure in any legal proceedings (including an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption or the NSW Ombudsman ) to which Flavitia is a party or is directly involved; disclosure to a member or officer of a law enforcement agency for use in connection with the detection, investigation or prosecution of an offence; where otherwise required or authorised by law to do so (for example, if Flavitia is required to comply with a search warrant or subpoena); where Flavitia considers this is reasonably necessary to avert a serious and imminent threat of: serious violence to a person; damage to property (including disruption to Flavitia's business, systems or operations). Part 4 of the Act prohibits covert surveillance (which is Surveillance other than that requiring notification in accordance with Part B below) by an employer without a covert surveillance authority issued under that Act. Prohibited Surveillance Flavitia will not carry out and does not condone any of the following which are prohibited under the Act: Surveillance of Employees in a change room, toilet facility or shower or other bathing facility in the Workplace; Surveillance of Employees using work Surveillance devices when Employees are not at work, except as permitted under the Act and this Policy; and Blocking emails or internet access of an employee except as permitted under the Act and Flavitia policies, including Part C of this Policy. Surveillance Procedures Part A - Authorisation Employees are prohibited from conducting any form of Workplace Surveillance or from accessing Surveillance Records or Surveillance Information, except the following Employees who are only authorised for the purposes of performing their designated duties as Employees: Employees (including those within Information Technology and Digital Services) whose normal duties include routine back up or restoration of data, conduct of audits, review of web filtering, email filtering, document retrieval or logs, or other activities relating to Flavitia's systems, including IT Resources and Networks; Employees (including those in Safety and Security) whose normal duties include review of camera footage and of building access (including use of building access devices); or Employees who are specifically authorised under this Part A to conduct Surveillance or to access Surveillance Information or Surveillance Records.

For the avoidance of doubt, Surveillance requests made under this clause will only be approved if the CEO is reasonably satisfied that the request is for a purpose specified in the act. Notice Requirements This Policy is formal notice to Employees that Flavitia does the following in accordance with this Policy: it conducts Surveillance in the form of Monitoring in the Workplace; where authorised under the Act or this Policy, it conducts Workplace Surveillance other than Monitoring; and it creates, accesses, uses and discloses information or records in relation to Surveillance, including as part of Monitoring. Flavitia also provides notice to Employees about Surveillance (including Monitoring) in other formats as follows: in the case of Monitoring by cameras, by means of physical signage at the entrances to or within facilities grounds; by obtaining a signed acknowledgement when an employee commences employment; by means of regular (usually every six months) reminder notifications to all Employees by the CEO means of an online notice referring to this and other relevant policies when an employee activates their Flavitia account for the first time; for new methods of Monitoring, specific written notice to all Employees (which may be given by email) at least 14 days before that routine Monitoring commences. For Surveillance approved under Part A, Flavitia must send a written notice to an individual employee (which may be given by email) before that Surveillance commences and must specify: the type of Surveillance or new form of Monitoring to be carried out; how it will be carried out; when it will start; whether it will be continuous or intermittent; and whether it will be for a specified limited period or ongoing.
