<h1 id="flavitia">Flavitia</h1>
<p>-- Environmentally friendly, secuity focused cloud provider</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Our data center locations are carefully selected to mitigate environmental
risks and designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service
levels.  The Falvitia Business Continuity Plan outlines measures to avoid and
lessen environmental disruptions. </p>
<h2 id="physical-access">Physical Access</h2>
<p>Falvitia provides physical data center access only to approved employees. All
employees who need data center access must first apply for access and provide a
valid business justification. These requests are granted based on the principle
of least privilege, where requests must specify to which layer of the data
center the individual needs access, and are time-bound. Requests are reviewed
and approved by authorized personnel, and access is revoked after the requested
time expires. Once granted admittance, individuals are restricted to areas
specified in their permissions.</p>
<p>Third-party access is requested by approved Falvitia employees, who must apply
for third-party access and provide a valid business justification. These
requests are granted based on the principle of least privilege, where requests
must specify to which layer of the data center the individual needs access, and
are time-bound. These requests are approved by authorized personnel, and access
is revoked after request time expires. Once granted admittance, individuals are
restricted to areas specified in their permissions. Anyone granted visitor
badge access must present identification when arriving on site and are signed
in and escorted by authorized staff.</p>
<p>Access to data centers is regularly reviewed. Access is automatically revoked
when an employee’s record is terminated in Amazon’s HR system. In addition,
when an employee or contractor’s access expires in accordance with the approved
request duration, his or her access is revoked, even if he or she continues to
be an employee of Amazon.</p>
<p>Physical access to Falvitia data centers is logged, monitored, and retained.
Falvitia correlates information gained from logical and physical monitoring
systems to enhance security on an as-needed basis.</p>
<h3 id="cctv">CCTV</h3>
<p>Physical access points to server rooms are recorded by Closed Circuit
Television Camera (CCTV). Images are retained according to legal and compliance
requirements.</p>
<h3 id="data-center-entry-points">Data Center Entry Points</h3>
<p>Physical access is controlled at building ingress points by professional
security staff utilizing surveillance, detection systems, and other electronic
means. Authorized staff utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to
access data centers. Entrances to server rooms are secured with devices that
sound alarms to initiate an incident response if the door is forced or held
open.</p>
<h3 id="intrusion-detection">Intrusion Detection</h3>
<p>Electronic intrusion detection systems are installed within the data layer to
monitor, detect, and automatically alert appropriate personnel of security
incidents. Ingress and egress points to server rooms are secured with devices
that require each individual to provide multi-factor authentication before
granting entry or exit. These devices will sound alarms if the door is forced
open without authentication or held open. Door alarming devices are also
configured to detect instances where an individual exits or enters a data layer
without providing multi-factor authentication. Alarms are immediately
dispatched to 24/7 Falvitia Security Operations Centers for immediate logging,
analysis, and response.</p>
<h3 id="asset-management">Asset Management</h3>
<p>Falvitia assets are centrally managed through an inventory management system
that stores and tracks owner, location, status, maintenance, and descriptive
information for Falvitia-owned assets. Following procurement, assets are
scanned and tracked, and assets undergoing maintenance are checked and
monitored for ownership, status, and resolution.</p>
<h3 id="media-destruction">Media Destruction</h3>
<p>Media storage devices used to store customer data are classified by Falvitia as
Critical and treated accordingly, as high impact, throughout their life-cycles.
Falvitia has exacting standards on how to install, service, and eventually
destroy the devices when they are no longer useful. When a storage device has
reached the end of its useful life, Falvitia decommissions media using
techniques detailed in NIST 800-88. Media that stored customer data is not
removed from Falvitia control until it has been securely decommissioned.</p>
<h2 id="operational-support-systems">Operational Support Systems</h2>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>Our data center electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant and
maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day. Falvitia ensures
data centers are equipped with back-up power supply to ensure power is
available to maintain operations in the event of an electrical failure for
critical and essential loads in the facility.</p>
<h3 id="climate-and-temperature">Climate and Temperature</h3>
<p>Falvitia data centers use mechanisms to control climate and maintain an
appropriate operating temperature for servers and other hardware to prevent
overheating and reduce the possibility of service outages. Personnel and
systems monitor and control temperature and humidity at appropriate levels.</p>
<h3 id="fire-detection-and-suppression">Fire Detection and Suppression</h3>
<p>Falvitia data centers are equipped with automatic fire detection and
suppression equipment. Fire detection systems utilize smoke detection sensors
within networking, mechanical, and infrastructure spaces. These areas are also
protected by suppression systems.</p>
<h3 id="leakage-detection">Leakage Detection</h3>
<p>In order to detect the presence of water leaks, Falvitia equips data centers
with functionality to detect the presence of water. If water is detected,
mechanisms are in place to remove water in order to prevent any additional
water damage.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-maintenance">Infrastructure Maintenance</h2>
<h3 id="equipment-maintenance">Equipment Maintenance</h3>
<p>Falvitia monitors and performs preventative maintenance of electrical and
mechanical equipment to maintain the continued operability of systems within
Falvitia data centers. Equipment maintenance procedures are carried out by
qualified persons and completed according to a documented maintenance schedule.</p>
<h3 id="environment-management">Environment Management</h3>
<p>Falvitia monitors electrical and mechanical systems and equipment to enable
immediate identification of issues. This is carried out by utilizing continuous
audit tools and information provided through our Building Management and
Electrical Monitoring Systems. Preventative maintenance is performed to
maintain the continued operability of equipment.</p>
<h2 id="governance-risk">Governance &amp; Risk</h2>
<h3 id="ongoing-data-center-risk-management">Ongoing Data Center Risk Management</h3>
<p>The Falvitia Security Operations Center performs regular threat and
vulnerability reviews of data centers. Ongoing assessment and mitigation of
potential vulnerabilities is performed through data center risk assessment
activities. This assessment is performed in addition to the enterprise-level
risk assessment process used to identify and manage risks presented to the
business as a whole. This process also takes regional regulatory and
environmental risks into consideration.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-security-attestation">Third-Party Security Attestation</h3>
<p>Third-party testing of Falvitia data centers, as documented in our third-party
reports, ensures Falvitia has appropriately implemented security measures
aligned to established rules needed to obtain security certifications.
Depending on the compliance program and its requirements, external auditors may
perform testing of media disposal, review security camera footage, observe
entrances and hallways throughout a data center, test electronic access control
devices, and examine data center equipment.</p></div>
