<h2 id="policy-statement">Policy Statement</h2>
<p>Flavitia is committed to ensuring information security by preventing
unauthorised access to, and modification or impairment of, its Digital Services
and the information stored within them; through a combination of preventative
measures, Cyber Security Incident Management, and the participation of all
Authorised Users in ensuring that security measures are not undermined.</p>
<p>Flavitia recognises foreign interference as a specific subset of cyber threat
which is guarded against by instilling a positive security culture, embedding
security awareness and decision making practices into all aspects of Flavitia,
as well as implementing preventative measures and risk mitigation practices.</p>
<p>Flavitia acknowledges that a strong security culture requires all Authorised
Users to be trained in and be aware of their Cyber Security responsibilities.</p>
<p>Flavitia aims to maintain an appropriate level of Cyber Security to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of all Digital Services.</p>
<p><strong>Preventative Measures</strong></p>
<p>Preventative measures are in place to provide security controls around
Flavitia's Digital Services. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firewall: Flavitia uses firewall hardware and software to log and protect
internet and network usage, including connectivity of all Authorised Users and
Digital Services, to prevent known threats and vulnerabilities from being
exploited. The strength and configuration of the firewall used is based around
industry standards to ensure the quality of protection on all Flavitia Digital
Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blocking of websites: Flavitia blocks certain website URLs, as their content is
considered unsafe, unacceptable, or would put people, Digital Services, or
Flavitia at risk. This includes, but is not limited to, malicious, gambling,
pornographic, or terrorist content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blocking of applications: Flavitia occasionally places a throttle or limit on
the internet traffic to certain high-bandwidth streaming applications to
prevent an unnecessary drain on Flavitia Digital Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antivirus software: Flavitia uses antivirus software to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its Digital Services and detect
any malware or similar malicious code. Where possible, its source is traced.
The strength of the antivirus software and the regularity that it is set to
scan is based around industry standards. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated Spam and Phishing detection: Flavitia uses systems that detect spam,
phishing messages, and other malicious email entering and leaving its email
servers, in order to protect against Spam, Phishing attempts and viral
outbreaks. The configuration of this software is adjusted to cater for new
types of Spam, Phishing attempts and other forms of malicious email when ITDS
is made aware of them. As such, reporting of suspicious activity is still a
vital part of this process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Password strength: Flavitia requires a certain level of complexity in all
Authorised Users' passwords, to ensure that access to Digital Services is
within industry standards. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification and management of technical vulnerabilities: Flavitia uses a
range of tools to identify, monitor and manage vulnerabilities on its Digital
Services. Vulnerabilities will be assessed for their risk to Flavitia
operations and managed accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cryptography: Flavitia procures digital certificates using a bona fide and
valid Certificate Authority (CA), and ensures that cryptographic certificates
are issued and managed as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness Information: Flavitia provides awareness information and training
relating to Cyber Security, Phishing, and Good Practices. This information is
available on Flavitia website and by following #SecurityCorner on Yammer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring of logs: ITDS conducts routine monitoring of Digital Services and
logs related to those services. This monitoring may reveal signs of external
interference, including foreign interference, which is handled in accordance
with the Cyber Security Incident Management Process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p><strong>Responsibility of All Users</strong></p>
<p>Cyber Security Events or breaches of security controls must be reported to
the IT Services
Desk</p>
<p>Any and all remote desktop software presents a significant threat to the
security of Flavitia's Digital Services. As such, the CDO &amp; CISO (or nominee)
must first authorise and approve any software solution that provides remote
access, in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
Flavitia Digital Services.</p>
<p>When using or accessing Flavitia Digital Services from off-site, using a
Flavitia or personal device, be aware of the inherent risks to the privacy of
confidential and sensitive information kept in those services. All remote
access provisions are expected to be used for Flavitia business only, and
certain restrictions will need to be in force at all times:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure the device used to access Flavitia Digital Services is up-to-date and
virus free, and will not circumvent or compromise the security controls
Flavitia places around its Digital Services. Refer to the [Acceptable Use of
Digital Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appropriate level of care and caution is exercised to prevent unauthorised
access to any and all Digital Services (see the [Digital Information Security
Policy]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appropriate level of care and caution is exercised to maintain the security
of confidential and sensitive information, to protect the privacy of all
Authorised Users and Flavitia (see the [Privacy
Policy]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that where remote access to Flavitia Digital Services is provided,
such access is subject to the [Acceptable Use of Digital Services
Policy]</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of Flavitia</strong></p>
<p>Through the Digital Security Steering Committee (DSSC), as established in
the [Digital Information Security
Policy]</p>
<p>Through the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) ensuring Flavitia has effective
cyber security and foreign interference controls in place to protect Flavitia.</p>
<p>Through the Office of Marketing and Communication, the review of digital
material which can pose a risk to Flavitia is performed as detailed in
the [Media, Social Media and Public Commentary
Policy]</p>
<p>Providing appropriate training and awareness campaigns created to educate
Authorised Users around Cyber Security Events and issues, as well as foreign
interference awareness, in order to improve the effectiveness of the reporting
and response processes.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the CDO &amp; CISO</strong></p>
<p>Authorising the appropriate group(s) within ITDS to perform specific procedures
for ensuring Flavitia's Cyber Security, including those identified within this
policy.</p>
<p>All Cyber Security Events reported to ITDS are evaluated to determine if a
response is required. If a response is required, the Event becomes a Cyber
Security Incident and will be managed by the appropriate response team in
accordance with the steps outlined in the Cyber Security Incident Management
Process (KB0014354, available to ITDS Staff Only). This will ensure a
consistent and effective approach to the management of Cyber Security
Incidents, including communications, and that the collection and analysis of
evidence from the Cyber Security Incident occurs without compromising its
integrity.</p>
<p>Logs are reviewed to identify and manage Cyber Security Incidents and/or
breaches in the security of Digital Services, as well as create and manage
records and documents associated with Cyber Security Incidents for further
analysis. In the event of a breach in Flavitia's Information Security, ITDS
will utilise the ITDS Data Breach Incident Report Process (KB0014961, available
to ITDS Staff Only) to triage the event and notify appropriate parties within
Flavitia if personal data is involved, as defined in the [Privacy
Policy]</p>
<p>Controls and other preventative measures are put in place to avoid Cyber
Security Incidents, either as a result of experience from previous Cyber
Security Incidents or as a countermeasure or deterrent to likely Cyber Security
Incidents. These measures are documented and regularly reviewed to ensure their
validity and reliability.</p>
<p>Ensures the sharing of cyber intelligence with other Australian and New Zealand
Universities and the Government to help build a common picture of interference
threats across the sector and to share countermeasures, to the extent that it
does not compromise Flavitia’s security posture.</p>
<p>Nominated members of ITDS actively participate in higher education sector and
government cyber security exercises, as appropriate.</p>
<p>In the event that a Cyber Security Incident is identified as originating from a
state based foreign actor, escalation within and external to Flavitia is
considered appropriate in the interests of national security.</p>
<h2 id="guideline">Guideline</h2>
<p>Flavitia maintains a MOE to provide a consistent and secure IT environment
across Flavitia Digital Services. This also allows Flavitia to maintain better
control over any technical vulnerabilities that are known, or that arise, 
impacting that environment. All computers procured by Flavitia following its
typical procurement process will have an appropriate MOE in place by default,
if possible. It is recommended that all Flavitia Digital Services are part of
an MOE wherever possible.</p>
