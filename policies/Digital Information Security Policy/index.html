<h2 id="section-2-definitions">Section 2 - Definitions</h2>
<p>Words and Terms used in this policy are defined in Section 6 — Terms and Acronyms. </p>
<h2 id="section-3-policy-statement">Section 3 - Policy Statement</h2>
<p>Flavitia is committed to ensuring that access to and use of Flavitia's digital information, and Digital Services are efficient, lawful, valid and ethical, and subject to appropriate security controls. </p>
<p>Flavitia aims to maintain a state of digital security where the risk of loss or damage to digital information and services is managed to an acceptable level. </p>
<p>Flavitia acknowledges that good security requires all Authorised Users to be trained in and be aware of their digital information security responsibilities. </p>
<h2 id="section-4-procedures">Section 4 - Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="part-a-responsibilities">Part A - Responsibilities</h3>
<p>All Authorised Users must ensure that their use of Flavitia digital information:
* is for official business purposes only, and
* complies with Flavitia policies and procedures. (see the Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy, the Email and Internet Policy, and the Cyber Security Policy for more details).</p>
<p>All Authorised Users must take the following steps to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to digital information [Ref. Cybercrime Act schedule 1]:
* Use strong passwords (see Part I below);
* Never reveal or share passwords with others under any circumstances;
* Never ask for or use another user's password;
* Ensure that sensitive information cannot be observed from their workstation's screen;
* Log out or lock their workstation before leaving it unattended;

<p>Supervisors must immediately ensure that incidents referred to them are reported to the IT Service Desk. </p>
<p>Authorised Users must not publicise security incidents, as publicity increases risks to Flavitia. </p>
<p>In accordance with the Cyber Security Incident Management Process, only defined staff are to lead security incident investigations and evidence collection. </p>
<p>All Authorised Users are required to understand their responsibilities regarding information security, including an awareness of those parts of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) relevant to their duties. </p>
<p>The CEO is responsible for:
* ensuring this policy and associated policies, procedures, standards and guidelines are publicised to all Authorised Users; and 
* establishing the DSSC. </p>
<p>The Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, or their nominated representative, is responsible for: 
* applying this policy and the ISMS;
* managing information security incidents in accordance with the ISMS;
* making recommendations to the DSSC; and 
* ensuring that third party access to Flavitia Digital Services is approved by
the system business application owner and conforms with the ISMS. </p>
<h3 id="part-b-information-security-awareness">Part B - Information Security Awareness</h3>
<p>ITDS will publish IT Security Advisories to raise awareness of security issues. </p>
<p>Flavitia will provide access to training and advice to Authorised Users to raise awareness of their digital information security responsibilities. See the Cyber Security Policy and Flavitia Cyber Security website for more details. </p>
<h3 id="part-c-configuration-management">Part C - Configuration Management</h3>
<p>ITDS will maintain a Configuration Management Data Base of all Flavitia Digital Services assets, including business ownership and support details. While hardware components may be listed as part of a service provided, the physical hardware has a separate Asset Management Policy that must be followed from a purchasing and financial perspective. [Ref. ISM Controls 0289, 0291]. </p>
<p>The CDO &amp; CISO, or their nominated representative, will ensure that Flavitia digital information has a defined data classification that includes a consistent assessment of legal and regulatory requirements, business sensitivity, criticality and proprietary information. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 8.2.1; ISM Control 0293]. </p>
<h3 id="part-d-business-continuity-management">Part D - Business Continuity Management</h3>
<p>Business application owners of Flavitia Digital Services are to ensure that the development and testing of Business Continuity Plans include how their area(s) of responsibility will continue to function in the case of service interruptions or failure of Digital Services or other critical technology. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 17.1; ISM Control 0118, 0193]. </p>
<h3 id="part-e-user-awareness-and-responsibilities">Part E - User Awareness and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Managers and supervisors, in conjunction with the business application owner, Privacy Officer, and the Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, shall ensure that all Authorised Users accessing Digital Services are made aware of their responsibility regarding data privacy and security. </p>
<p>The ITDS Staff Code of Ethics is provided to assist ITDS staff in managing their responsibilities for safe use and provision of IT digital services. </p>
<h3 id="part-f-access-control">Part F - Access Control</h3>
<p>The business application owner and/or service delivery manager, in consultation with the CDO &amp; CISO (or nominee), is responsible for ensuring that:
* physical access to digital information and information processing facilities is restricted. 
* information processing facilities are secured against damage. </p>
<p>To prevent unauthorised logical access to data and services, ITDS will:
* segregate systems containing sensitive or critical information to secure hardware and networks or otherwise configure them to meet security and legislative requirements;
* restrict access at network and application levels.
* restrict access to source code to only those with a valid requirement;
* generally ensure all access to Flavitia Digital Services is based on the principle of least privilege (the minimum level of access that can be provided whilst still allowing the Authorised User to perform their role and/or studies); and
* remove access when it is no longer required or authorised </p>
<h3 id="part-g-maintenance-and-review">Part G - Maintenance and Review</h3>
<p>Flavitia will review ITDS Digital Services as follows: 
* ITDS will:
    * adopt change management processes, as described in the ITDS Change Management Process Document (accessible through the ServiceNow Knowledge Base, article 0010688), for all identified Digital Services; [Ref ISM Control 1121]; 
    * regularly review Digital Service capacity, to ensure continued adequate capacity;
    * maintain backups and test the restoration of backups at least twice yearly; 
    * log and audit use of and changes to ITDS Digital Services; and
    * retain logs for routine reviewing and maintenance purposes [Ref ISO 27002 section 12.4]
* Digital Services administrators and ITDS staff are to maintain reviewable activity logs. </p>
<h3 id="part-h-compliance">Part H - Compliance</h3>
<p>Flavitia will ensure:
* breaches of legal, civil, regulatory or contractual obligations are avoided, wherever possible.
* policy, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements are explicitly defined and documented for each Digital Service in use. [Ref ISO 27002 section 18.1.1].
* audits of operational Digital Services must actively minimise the risk of disruption, be conducted in accordance with Flavitia's Audit Plan, and be non-intrusive, unless otherwise approved by the business application owner.
* Digital Services audit tools are used only with permission of the CDO &amp; CISO. </p>
<p>Policy breaches may result in disciplinary action being taken in accordance with relevant misconduct policies or staff agreements. </p>
<p>Any deviation from ITDS policies and processes must involve an Approved Exemption Process to address the technical reasons and/or legitimate business requirements, and related potential risks to ITDS or Flavitia as a whole. An exemption request must be completed by the relevant Service Delivery Manager (or delegate). See the Exemption Process (as attached ServiceNow Knowledge Base KB0013593 — requires staff login) for more details. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 5.1.1]. </p>
<h3 id="part-i-authorised-user-credentials">Part I - Authorised User Credentials</h3>
<p>Flavitia uses password(s) as the primary protection for its User accounts, including Privileged Access Users. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of the user’s credentials and can put the Digital Services of the entire Flavitia at risk. As such, all Authorised Users are responsible for taking the appropriate steps to select, secure, and manage their passwords. See the Password Protection Guide for more information. </p>
<p>Any and all Credentials assigned to Authorised Users are for their individual
use only. Authorised Users must not share or disclose their Credentials to
anyone, including supervisors, colleagues, friends, family, or IT staff. </p>
<p>Any misuse of User Credentials to Elevate a User's Digital Service privileges
above what has been authorised for their use will be considered to be a breach
of policy and an act of misconduct. </p>
<p>ITDS will place controls around the level of complexity that passwords require,
to ensure all Users have strong passwords. Strong passwords have the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum of 8 characters</li>
<li>Contains characters from at least three of the four groups below: <ul>
<li>Upper case letters [A, B, C...]</li>
<li>Lower case letters [a, b, c...]</li>
<li>Numbers [0, 1, 2, 3...]</li>
<li>Special characters [!@#$%^*()_+=[]{}?] (Do not use '"&amp;\&lt;&gt;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is not a password that has been recently used (within the last 5 passwords) </li>
</ul>
<p>All passwords must be changed regularly, through the password management web
applications for  and staff accessible through Flavitia's website, or the
appropriate application. Forced password reset periods will be determined as
needed. Passwords can be changed more frequently if desired, and should be
changed immediately if there is any possibility that the password or account
may have been compromised.</p>
<p>Passwords or login Credentials shall not be stored in clear text in electronic
documents, on electronic locations (such as personal drives, shared drives,
applications, SharePoint), or on paper in an unsecured location (such as a
post-it note on a monitor, under a keyboard, or in an unlocked filing cabinet).
Making use of a corporate encrypted password vault solution is acceptable as
long as it has been assessed for security by ITDS and approved by the CDO &amp;
CISO (or nominee). </p>
<h3 id="part-j-privileged-user-credentials">Part J - Privileged User Credentials</h3>
<p>Privileged Access Users are expected to use stronger passwords than those required by Authorised Users (see the Password Protection Guide for more details). </p>
<p>Privileged Access Users should use Credentials with administrative or elevated
privileges to perform Administration or role-related activities only, and must
use their regular Authorised User Credentials for all other activities.  In
particular, internet access while using a privileged account must be limited to
what is needed for the administration or support activities for which the
privileged account was provided. </p>
<p>Flavitia may review the use of access accounts used for Privileged Access. </p>
<h3 id="part-k-remote-access">Part K - Remote Access</h3>
<p>Flavitia provides some remote access capability where it is satisfied this is necessary for Flavitia purposes; however, it is not required to provide remote access to its Digital Services to any Users. [Ref. ISO 27002 section 6.2.2] This may include: 
* The provision of web applications to allow  and staff to access Flavitia Digital Services remotely (such as the  management system, the learning and teaching system, digital library access), and
* ITDS approved remote desktop software solutions. The approved software used may be reviewed and changed periodically to ensure that security controls are still valid and up-to-date. </p>
<p>Acquisition, installation or use of any remote access software without the
authorization, approval and support of ITDS is considered a breach of policy.
See the Digital Services Implementation Policy for more information. </p>
<p>Flavitia does not provide, fund, or subsidise off-campus access to the internet
wherever other alternatives are present, except as required or allowed by the
Research Higher Degree Candidature Essential Resources Policy, Disability
Policy or Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2021
(section 3.3(3)). </p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided by Flavitia, it is the responsibility of the
Authorised User to ensure they have the necessary computer, modem, connection
media and software to connect to the internet. 
* Where such equipment is
provided, Flavitia's usual process for procurement will be followed (see the
Digital Services Implementation Policy for more details). 
* Where such
equipment is provided, Flavitia's usual processes for security and privacy will
be followed (see the Cyber Security Policy for more details). 
* Where such
equipment is provided by Flavitia, it remains the property of Flavitia, and all
relevant policies and processes (including the Acceptable Use of Digital
Services Policy) remain in effect at all times, regardless of the location of
the equipment. </p>
<h3 id="part-l-digital-security-steering-committee-dssc">Part L - Digital Security Steering Committee (DSSC)</h3>
<p>Flavitia has established the Digital Security Steering Committee (DSSC) to advise Flavitia Executive Committee and Flavitia Audit and Risk Committee on matters relating to the security of Flavitia's digital information. Chair and Members </p>
<p>The chair of the DSSC is the Director, Digital Strategy, Security and Risk, and
the committee includes representation from schools, divisions, Information
Technology and Digital Services, and the Privacy Officer and the Office of
Audit and Risk Assessment. Terms of Reference </p>
<p>The terms of reference of the DSSC are to:

* actively develop and champion at all levels of Flavitia an awareness of Information Security principles; and 
* routinely assess the digital landscape in the industry and amongst peers with the view of identifying opportunities and/or threats. </p>
<p>The group will correspond via email and meet face to face at least three times a year. </p>
<h2 id="part-m-information-security-management-system-isms">Part M - Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h2>
<p>The DSSC will review an ISMS based on Australian and international standards. </p>
<p>The ISMS will address security controls and practices to be implemented by Flavitia, including: 
* Cyber Security Incidents are contained, reported, analysed, and assessed, based on incident type, volume and impact.
