<h2 id="purpose-and-context">Purpose and Context</h2>
<p>Internet and Email services are vital to  Flavitia's  ability to function as a
modern higher learning institution and to further its vision, mission and
goals. However, these services can be misused, either accidentally or
intentionally, without a framework to provide guidance for how Flavitia expects
these services to be used. Certain legal requirements, ordinary lines of
management and approval, as well as general standards of respect and courtesy
apply to email and internet usage to the same degree as any other piece of
Flavitia formal business or communication activity.</p>
<p>This policy and the associated Procedures and Guide documents provide a
framework for the appropriate, effective and efficient use of Flavitia email
and internet services. In addition to general usage principles, the policy also
addresses related issues of privacy, confidentiality, security, and Authorised
Users' legal obligations.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all Authorised Users of Flavitia email and internet
(wired or wireless).</p>
<p>In compliance with the [Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment
(Data Retention) Act 2015 (Cth)] Flavitia does not provide anonymous internet
access, but may establish third party ISP services available for events or
specific arrangements.</p>
<p>Use of Flavitia email and internet service is expected to follow all other
relevant Flavitia policies, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy]</li>
<li>[Workplace Surveillance Policy]</li>
<li>[Code of Conduct]</li>
<li>[Email and Internet Procedures]</li>
<li>[Email and Internet Guide]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>Words and terms used in this policy are defined in Section 6 — Terms and Acronyms.</p>
<h2 id="policy-statement">Policy Statement</h2>
<p>Flavitia Email, both accounts and messages, remains the property of Flavitia.
All Flavitia staff, , and some associates of Flavitia are provided with access
to an individual Flavitia email account for the purposes of sending and
receiving official emails related to the business of Flavitia or the 's
enrolment and program of study.</p>
<p>When Authorised Users leave Flavitia, their User accounts—including documents,
emails and internet access (and records of access)—are archived and retired.
This means that ex-staff and - will not have access to their user accounts or
emails after leaving. Therefore, before leaving Flavitia, users are responsible
for:</p>
<ul>
<li>tidying their own documents and mailboxes;</li>
<li>ensuring their managers or teams have the necessary information to safeguard business operations;</li>
<li>making copies of any personal information that they will require;</li>
<li>contacting any internal or external correspondents to make them aware that</li>
<li>Flavitia email address will be retired (see the [Staff Separation
Checklist]
*ensuring Flavitia Intellectual Property remains with Flavitia. While copies of
personal data are acceptable, Flavitia business remains Flavitia property; no
departing Authorised User is permitted to take any Flavitia Digital
Information. See the [Intellectual Property
Policy] for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before leaving, staff are welcome to inform personal contacts of an appropriate
new email address, to avoid bounce messages. Upon leaving, staff should add an
Out of Office message indicating that they are no longer working in the
position they occupied, and that their manager should be contacted for Flavitia
business. However, a User leaving a forwarding message containing their new
position and/or email address is not appropriate, as staff email accounts are
intended for Flavitia business.</p>
<p>Flavitia provided internet access is generally made available to all Authorised
Users to conduct business, study and research. All Authorised Users are
required to adhere to the [Acceptable Use of Digital Services Policy]</p>
<p>Flavitia distributes important information, formal notices and other official
communications via Flavitia email accounts and expects staff and  to check
their account and read their Flavitia email regularly. Flavitia acknowledges
that the use of email can increase pressure on workplaces through the large
number of emails sent to some staff and the unrealistic expectation of an
immediate reply.</p>
<p>If any Authorised Users, including Eduroam users, breach the terms of this
policy, their access to Flavitia Digital Services may be limited or revoked,
and the matters may be referred to the relevant internal or external
authorities if Flavitia deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Flavitia endeavours to maintain the security of Flavitia email and internet but
it cannot guarantee confidentiality, or undiscovered interception or alteration
of communications (whether via email or interactions with internet sites and
services) by third parties.</p>
<p>Emails sent by staff members of Flavitia, especially when acting in their
official capacity, should include a signature line in keeping with Flavitia's
branding resources (requires staff login). Staff are advised that disclaimers
or other common signature line messages are able to be added as described in
the branding resources.</p>
<p>Incidental and occasional use of Flavitia email for personal use is acceptable.
However, use of the email system as a personal email solution is not
authorised.</p>
<p><strong>Authority of ITDS to Restrict Access</strong></p>
<p>As defined in the [Workplace Surveillance Policy], Flavitia is not required to
give notice of emails being blocked if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flavitia regards the content of the website or email, including any attachment, as menacing, harassing or offensive, for example, pornographic, gambling, or terrorist websites;</li>
<li>the email is or contains a commercial electronic message, as defined in the [Spam Act 2003]</li>
<li>the content or attachments of the email would or might result in unauthorised interference with, damage to, or operations of a Digital Service (including any program run or data stored on any Digital Service);</li>
<li>the sender of the email has been identified as having previously sent malicious content to the organisation;</li>
<li>Flavitia is not aware (and cannot reasonably be expected to be aware) of whether an employee has sent that email or of the identity of the employee who has sent that email.</li>
</ul>
<p>A breach of this policy will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant
staff employment agreement [Code of Conduct] and/or Flavitia policy.</p>
