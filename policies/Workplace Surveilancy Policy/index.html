<p>The purpose of this Policy is to describe the circumstances in which Flavitia
conducts Surveillance of its Employees.</p>
<p>The [Workplace Surveillance Act 2005] regulates Surveillance of Employees at
work by means of camera, computer, and tracking devices, and requires that
Employees be notified as to the nature of that Surveillance.</p>
<p>This Policy constitutes the provision of notice to Employees of Flavitia's
Workplace Surveillance under the Act.</p>
<p><strong>Application and Compliance</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies to all current Employees, contractors, consultants and
Flavitia controlled entities who have access to any Flavitia premises,
equipment, or systems, including IT Resources and Networks.</p>
<p>Flavitia may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for any breach of this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy should be read in conjunction with relevant Flavitia policies, including:
* [Code of Conduct]

* [Email Policy]
* [IT Acceptable Use of Resources Policy]
* [Mobile Telecommunication Devices Policy]

the Act.</p>

<p>"Act" means the [Workplace Surveillance Act 2005]</p>
</li>

he or she is actually performing work at the time, or at any other place while

<li>violent content;</li>
</ul>
</li>

information, or the creation of records, in a routine and passive manner. It
also includes routine review of that information or those records to ensure the
integrity, security and service delivery of Flavitia's systems, including IT
Resources and Networks. However, and for the avoidance of doubt, Monitoring
does not involve actively investigating or keeping track of an individual or
his or her activities.</p>

is reasonable to assume the employee is aware of and understands the relevant
policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if Flavitia intends to prevent delivery of an email, Flavitia gives the
employee notice (which can be by email) that delivery of the email will be
blocked.</p>
</li>
