<h1 id="bring-your-own-device-byod-standard">Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Standard</h1>
<p><strong>Standard Number:</strong> IT.1.1.3S</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Acceptable Use of Technology</p>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Information Security Services</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> December 31, 2019</p>
<p><strong>Revision History:</strong> Originally effective December 18, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Review Date:</strong> December 30, 2022</p>
<h2 id="purpose-scope-and-responsibilities">Purpose, Scope, and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Personally owned computing devices are increasingly being used to access
Flavitia Technology Resources and Flavitia Data. A security breach when using a
personal device could result in loss or compromise of Flavitia Data, damage
and/or unauthorized access to Flavitia Technology Resources, and/or financial
harm to Flavitia.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Standard is to establish minimum security requirements for
personally owned devices that connect to Flavitia Technology Resources and/or
access Flavitia Data, including but not limited to smartphones, tablets,
laptops, and notebooks.</p>
<p>Individuals who elect to utilize a personal device to access Flavitia
Technology Resources are responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abiding by the requirements identified within this document;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any damages and criminal and/or civil charges resulting from the activities
conducted on their personal device while connected to a Flavitia Technology
Resource; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All transactions made under their Authentication to a Flavitia Technology Resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Flavitia is not responsible or liable for the maintenance, backup, or loss of
data on a personal device and does not accept responsibility for the security
of personal devices including loss, theft, or damage.</p>
<p>The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for implementation and
enforcement of this Standard. Information Technology Services (“ITS”) is
responsible for Flavitia authentication systems, verifying authentication
credentials provided, troubleshooting connectivity or authentication issues,
and performing vulnerability scans of the Flavitia Network.</p>
<p>Deploying infrastructure and maintaining the availability of the Flavitia Network
is a shared responsibility of ITS Network Services and other college/department
IT groups on campus.</p>
<h2 id="personal-device-use">Personal Device Use</h2>
<p>Individuals who elect to utilize a personal device to access Flavitia
Technology Resources, whether for personal use, Flavitia business, on Flavitia
time, or during business travel must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abide by the Acceptable Use of Data and Technology Resources Policy;</li>
<li>Maintain and backup the personal data stored on the device;</li>
<li>Ensure the physical security of the device to prevent loss, theft, and/or damage;</li>
<li>Report lost or stolen devices that contained Flavitia Data;</li>
<li>Ensure the device meets the security requirements identified within Section 3 of this document.</li>
</ul>
<p>A personally owned device must never disrupt use or function of the Flavitia
Network and/or Flavitia Information System to which it is connected. Flavitia
will ban or prevent any device from accessing the Flavitia Network that
continually causes disruptions to Flavitia Technology Resources.</p>
<p>The device owner must change their WVU Login password immediately when a
personal device that has access Flavitia Data is lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Identity and Access Management Policy, Authentication is required
before a device will be permitted to access the Flavitia Network.</p>
<p>Personally owned devices must never be used as a Flavitia server or networking
device.</p>
<ol>
<li>DEVICE SECURITY</li>
</ol>
<p>To prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access, device owners must never
leave their device unattended.</p>
<p>All devices that connect to Flavitia Technology Resources and/or access
Flavitia Data must meet the following security requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employ an active form of access protection such as a passcode, passphrase,
facial recognition, or fingerprint;</li>
<li>Passwords/passphrases must meet the minimum requirements identified within the Password Standard;</li>
<li>Be configured to lock or logout and require a user to re-authenticate if left
unattended for more than 15 minutes. Devices that do not support this
capability must be secured alternatively such as restricting access in a locked
room;</li>
<li>Run a Supported Operating System that is patched and updated regularly;</li>
<li>Devices must be configured to allow Remote Wipe in the event the device is lost
or stolen. Devices that do not support Remote Wipe functionality must be
encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Devices that are Jailbroken, Rooted, or have been subject to any other method
of changing built-in protections must not be used to access Flavitia Technology
Resources.</p>
<h2 id="conducting-flavitia-business">Conducting Flavitia Business</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the Acceptable Use of Data and Technology Resources Policy,
Flavitia provides the use of Flavitia Technology Resources, including Devices,
which must be used by Authorized Individuals as the primary means to create,
store, send, or receive Flavitia Data.</p>
<p><em>De minimis</em> use of personally owned devices is permitted to access Flavitia
Data and/or conduct Flavitia business provided the device meets the security
requirements identified within Section 3 of this Standard and the device is
made available for inspection by Flavitia to ensure appropriate security
controls are in place.</p>
<p>Use of a personal device as the primary means to create, store, send, or
receive Flavitia Data and/or conduct Flavitia business is prohibited.</p>
<p>Data classified as Sensitive in the Sensitive Data Policy must never be
accessed via or downloaded to a personally owned device.</p>
<p>Software licensed to Flavitia must never be downloaded to a personally owned
device unless specifically permitted by the license (e.g., Microsoft Office).</p>
<p>Flavitia Data subject to document requests (e.g., Freedom of Information Act or
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) or document production (e.g.,
warrants, subpoenas, court orders) stored on a personally owned device must be
produced upon the request of Flavitia.</p>
<p>Any Flavitia Data downloaded to a personally owned device must be destroyed,
removed, or returned to Flavitia once the individual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is no longer employed by Flavitia;</li>
<li>No longer requires access to Flavitia Data due to changing job responsibilities; or,</li>
<li>Is no longer the owner or primary user of the device.</li>
</ul>
