<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This acceptable use AUP (the “AUP”) defines acceptable practices for the use of
Flavitia Data Centers services (the “Service”). By using the Service, you
acknowledge that you and Customers that have gained access to the Service
through your account (“Customers”) are responsible for compliance with the AUP.
You are responsible for violations of this AUP by any Customer that accesses
the Services through your account. While it is not our intent to control or
monitor online experience or the content of online communications, we may edit
or remove content that we deem to be in violation of the AUP or that we
otherwise deem unlawful, harmful or offensive. The AUP applies to all aspects
of the Service. “Flavitia Data Centers” means Flavitia Data Centers, and all of
its affiliates (including direct and indirect subsidiaries and parents).
“Flavitia Data Centers Network” includes, without limitation, Flavitia Data
Centers’ constructed or leased transmission network, including all equipment,
systems, facilities, services and products incorporated or used in such
transmission network.</p>
<p>This AUP is designed to assist in protecting the Flavitia Data Centers Network,
the Service, our Customers and the Internet community as a whole from improper
and/or illegal activity over the Internet. In situations where data
communications are carried across networks of other Internet Service Providers
(ISPs), Customers of the Flavitia Data Centers Network must also conform to the
applicable acceptable use policies of such other ISPs.</p>
<h2 id="rights-of-flavitia-data-centers">Rights of Flavitia Data Centers</h2>
<p>Suspension or Termination of Service if Customers engage in conduct while using
the Service that violates the AUP, or is otherwise illegal or improper,
Flavitia Data Centers reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate the
Service or the Customer’s access to the Service. Flavitia Data Centers will
generally attempt to notify you of any activity in violation of the AUP and
request that the Customer cease such activity; however, in cases where the
operation of the Flavitia Data Centers Network is threatened or cases involving
unsolicited commercial email/SPAM, mail relaying, alteration of your source IP
address information, denial of service attacks, illegal activities, harassment
or copyright infringement, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
Service or the Customer’s access to the Service without notification. In
addition, we may take any other appropriate action against a Customer for
violations of the AUP. We do not make any promise, nor do we have any
obligation, to monitor or police activity occurring using the Service and will
have no liability to any party, including you, for any violation of the AUP.</p>
<h2 id="cooperation-with-investigations">Cooperation with Investigations</h2>
<p>Flavitia Data Centers will cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies
and other parties involved in investigating claims of illegal or inappropriate
activity. Flavitia Data Centers reserves the right to disclose customer
information to the extent authorized by federal or state law. In those
instances, involving child pornography, Flavitia Data Centers complies with all
applicable federal and state laws including providing notice to the National
Center for the Missing and Exploited Children or other designated agencies.</p>
<h2 id="modifications-to-aup">Modifications to AUP</h2>
<p>Flavitia Data Centers reserves the right to modify this AUP at any time without
notice. We will attempt to notify our customer of any such modifications either
via e-mail or by posting a revised version of the AUP on our Website.</p>
<h2 id="unauthorized-access-interference">Unauthorized Access / Interference</h2>
<p>A Customer may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to or attempt to
interfere with or compromise the normal functioning, operation or security of,
any portion of the Flavitia Data Centers Network. A Customer may not use the
Service to engage in any activities that may interfere with the ability of
others to access or use the Service or the Internet. A Customer may not use the
Service to monitor any data, information or communications on any network or
system without authorization. A Customer may not attempt to gain unauthorized
access to the Customer accounts or passwords of other Customers.</p>
<h2 id="unsolicited-commercial-email-spamming-mail-bombing">Unsolicited Commercial Email / Spamming / Mail bombing</h2>
<p>A Customer may not use the Service to transmit unsolicited commercial e-mail
messages or deliberately send excessively large attachments to one recipient.
Any unsolicited commercial e-mail messages or a series of unsolicited
commercial e-mail messages or large attachments sent to one recipient is
prohibited. In addition, “spamming” or “mail bombing” is prohibited. Use of the
service of another provider to send unsolicited commercial email, spam or mail
bombs, to promote a site hosted on or connected to the Flavitia Data Centers
Network, is similarly prohibited. Likewise, a Customer may not use the Service
to collect responses from mass unsolicited e-mail messages.</p>
<h2 id="prohibited-uses-actions-illegal-activity">Prohibited Uses / Actions / Illegal Activity</h2>
<p>The Service shall not be used for any unlawful activities or in connection with
any criminal or civil violation. Use of the Service for transmission,
distribution, retrieval, or storage of any information, data or other material
in violation of any applicable law or regulation (including, where applicable,
any tariff or treaty) is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, the use
or transmission of any data or material protected by copyright, trademark,
trade secret, patent or other intellectual property right without proper
authorization and the transmission of any material that constitutes an illegal
threat, violates export control laws, or is obscene, defamatory or otherwise
unlawful; inappropriate and/or offensive communications or interactions with
Flavitia Data Centers staff.</p>
<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to install and use, or to have you install and use, any
appropriate devices to prevent violations of this AUP, including devices
designed to filter or terminate access to the Service.</p>
<h2 id="spoofing-fraud">Spoofing / Fraud</h2>
<p>Customers are prohibited from intentionally or negligently injecting false data
into the Internet, for instance in the form of bad routing information
(including but not limited to the announcing of networks owned by someone else
or reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) or incorrect DNS
information. A Customer may not attempt to send e-mail messages or transmit any
electronic communications using a name or address of someone other than the
Customer for purposes of deception. Any attempt to impersonate someone else by
altering source IP address information or by using forged headers or other
identifying information is prohibited. Any attempt to fraudulently conceal,
forge or otherwise falsify a Customer’s identity in connection with use of the
Service is prohibited.</p>
<h2 id="usenet-postings">USENET Postings</h2>
<p>All postings to USENET groups must comply with that group’s charter and other
policies. Customers are prohibited from cross posting to unrelated news groups
or to any news groups where the post does not meet that group’s charter.
Continued posting of off-topic messages, including commercial messages (unless
specifically invited) is prohibited. Disrupting newsgroups with materials,
postings or activities that are (as determined by Flavitia Data Centers in its
sole discretion) frivolous, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous,
hateful, excessive or repetitious, unless such materials or activities are
expressly allowed or encouraged under the newsgroup’s name, FAQ or charter.</p>
<h2 id="wireless-equipment">Wireless Equipment</h2>
<p>Colocation customers may not install cellular or wireless equipment/antennae on
the Flavitia Data Centers premises without prior written permission from
Flavitia Data Centers. Customer is responsible for removing unauthorized
equipment installed in violation of this AUP.</p>
<h2 id="complaints">Complaints</h2>
<p>Flavitia Data Centers receives complaints directly from Internet Customers,
through Internet organizations and through other parties. Flavitia Data Centers
shall not be required to determine the validity of complaints received before
taking action under this AUP.  A complaint from the recipient of commercial
email, whether received directly or through an anti-spamming organization,
shall be evidence that the message was unsolicited. Flavitia Data Centers has
no obligation to forward the complaint to the Customer or to identify the
complaining parties. The following activities are also prohibited:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intentionally transmitting files containing a computer virus or corrupted data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have specified bandwidth limitations for your Customer account, use of
  the Service shall not be in excess of those limitations. If a Customer is
  accessing the Service via a dial-up connection, we may terminate the Customer
  session if the Customer is connected for more than seven days in order to
  protect Flavitia Data Centers Network resources and maintain Service
  availability for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempting to circumvent or alter the processes or procedures to measure time,
  bandwidth utilization, or other methods to document use of Flavitia Data
 Centers’ services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available any software,
  program, product, or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which
  includes the facilitation of the means to deliver unsolicited commercial
  email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any activity that disrupts, degrades, harms or threatens to harm the Flavitia
  Data Centers Network or the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any use of another party’s electronic mail server to relay email without
  express permission from such other party is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other inappropriate activity or abuse of the Service (as determined by us
  in our sole discretion), whether or not specifically listed in this AUP, may
  result in suspension or termination of the Customer’s access to or use of the
  Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This listing of prohibited activities is not exhaustive, and Flavitia Data
Centers reserves the right to determine that any conduct that is or could be
harmful to the Flavitia Data Centers Network, Flavitia Data Centers’ customers
or Internet Customers is in violation of this AUP and to exercise any or all of
the remedies contained in this AUP.</p>
<p>In most cases, we will notify our customer of complaints received by us
regarding an alleged violation of this AUP. You agree to promptly investigate
all such complaints and take all necessary actions to remedy any violations of
this AUP. We may inform the complainant that you are investigating the
complaint and may provide the complainant with the necessary information to
contact you directly to resolve the complaint. You shall identify a
representative for the purposes of receiving such communications.</p>
<h2 id="responsibilities-of-customers">Responsibilities of Customers</h2>
<p>Customers are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
password and account information, as well as the security of their network. You
agree immediately to notify Flavitia Data Centers of any unauthorized use of
your account or any other breach of security known to you. If you become aware
of any violation of this AUP by any person, including Customers that have
accessed the Service through your account, you are required to notify us.</p>
<h2 id="impending-security-event-notification">Impending Security Event Notification</h2>
<p>All Customers of the Flavitia Data Centers Network are responsible for
notifying Flavitia Data Centers immediately if they become aware of an
impending event that may negatively affect the Flavitia Data Centers Network. 
This includes extortion threats that involve threat of “denial of service”
attacks, unauthorized access, or other security events.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>All Customers of the Flavitia Data Centers Network are responsible for
configuring their own systems to provide the maximum possible accountability.
Flavitia Data Centers shall not be liable for any damage caused by such system
configurations regardless of whether such configurations have been authorized
or requested by Flavitia Data Centers. For example, Customers should ensure
there are clear “path” lines in news headers so that the originator of a post
may be identified. Customers should also configure their Mail Transport Agents
(MTA) to authenticate (by look-up on the name or similar procedures) any system
that connects to perform a mail exchange and should generally present header
data as clearly possible. As another example, Customers should maintain logs of
dynamically assigned IP addresses. Customers of the Flavitia Data Centers
Network are responsible for educating themselves and configuring their systems
with at least basic security. Should systems at a Customer’s site be violated,
the Customer is responsible for reporting the violation and then fixing the
exploited system. For instance, should a site be abused to distribute
unlicensed software due to a poorly configured FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
